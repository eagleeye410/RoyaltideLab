## 🤖 The AGI identity

At its core, (real)AGI is an autonomous cognitive engine that operates beyond task-specific narrow AI. It maps high-dimensional sensory tokens directly into executable logical actions, treating environmental inputs as dynamic state spaces to be fully modeled, parsed, and mastered.

### 1. Belief Revision
Instead of static classification, Regent maintains a continuous world model. It continuously updates its internal belief states about the environment ($H$) as real-time multi-modal tokens ($E$) are processed:

### 2. Policy Stability & Safety
To guarantee operational reliability during long-horizon tasks, policy exploration is modeled as a discrete-time Martingale. This ensures the expected utility of future cognitive states remains balanced against current reward landscapes:

If unintended reward hacking or drift is detected, the safety guardrail isolates execution to prevent alignment failures.

### 3. Cognitive Alignment
To resolve discrepancies between its internal world model and reality, Regent evaluates the information loss across its neural layers using Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence. Low divergence confirms high understanding; high divergence triggers active exploration to close the information gap.

## 📲 Integration

### Neural Inference & Action Loop

```rust
let current_state = CognitiveState::fetch(agent_id);
let sensory_input = RegentIngestor::perceive(vec![VISION_FEED, SENSORY_API]);

// Revise world model using KL-Divergence guardrails
let updated_state = current_state.apply_bayes(sensory_input)
    .verify_logic_invariants() // Safety Check
    .map_err(|e| RegentError::AlignmentMismatch(e))?;

if updated_state.confidence > 0.9999 {
    Regent::execute_action(agent_id, updated_state.optimal_policy);
}
